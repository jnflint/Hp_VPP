New high performance 6-DOF Velocity Prediction Program.

It is a VPP based on different methodologies, you can estimate the performance of a sailing boat via DSYHS, via ORC VPP model or a physically correct approach using both towing tank and wind tunnel data or using CFD data.
New enhancements are being applied considering latest scientific achievements from ORC, SYRF, WUMTIA, DSYHS

These modes are selectable using the solver options.
